These also appear in 'phone_number' and they make it hard to study these particular restaurants because we are at risk of making our model inaccurate or biased, since they are not valid features of the dataset. A less glaring observation is one about 'business id column', where most Business IDs seem to be a six-digit number but the Business ID corresponding to Hueng Yuen Restaurant is a four-digit number. This may be an indication of bad/incomplete data because it is possible that the last two digits of the Business ID were never recorded.\n",

    "Examine the `invalid_zip_bus` dataframe we computed above and look at the businesses that DO NOT have the special MISSING ZIP code value.  Some of the invalid postal codes are just the full 9 digit code rather than the first 5 digits.  Create a new column named `postal5` in the original `bus` dataframe which contains only the first 5 digits of the `postal_code` column.   Finally, for any of the `postal5` ZIP code entries that were not a valid San Fransisco ZIP Code (according to `valid_zips`) set the entry to `None`.  \n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",

    "If restaurants' scores tend to improve from the first to the second inspection, this implies that more points will lie above the reference line than below. This is because the slope represents the ratio of second inspection scores to first inspection scores, and since that slope is 1, this means that it represents the restaurants whose score does not change from the first inspection to the second inspection. Points below the line have higher first inspection scores than second inspection scores.\n",
